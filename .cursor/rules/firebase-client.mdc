These scripts are client-side JS files that connect to Firebase Firestore from within a Telegram WebApp.

- Firebase SDK must be imported via CDN or dynamic import.
- `Telegram.WebApp` must be expanded and `tg.initDataUnsafe.user` used to identify users.
- Data is stored in Firestore in a `users` collection by Telegram ID.
- On first load, user document is created with fields like: `id`, `name`, `access`, `points`, `level`.
- Access can be `free` or `paid`.

Keep logic simple and interface mobile-first. Show content inside `#content`.
