// Applies to: bot.js

The file `bot.js` implements a Telegram bot using `node-telegram-bot-api`. Always respond using JavaScript (no TypeScript), and follow best practices for polling bots.

- Use dotenv to load sensitive variables.
- Always include `polling: true` for local testing.
- All links sent via `web_app.url` must be valid HTTPS.
- Use environment variable `WEBAPP_URL` from .env.
- Respond to `/start` and `/admin` commands with buttons that open WebApp pages.

Comment the logic clearly and check that links include timestamp parameters to avoid caching issues.
