This file implements an Express.js server that serves static files for a Telegram WebApp project.

- Always use `express.static()` to serve the `public/` folder.
- Support direct routing to `/`, `/admin.html` and fallback 404.
- Do not use EJS or view engines â€“ serve only static HTML/CSS/JS.
- Ports should default to `process.env.PORT || 3000`.
- Use `import.meta.url` and `__dirname` via fileURLToPath for ES modules.

Avoid unnecessary middleware and keep the server lightweight.
